STEM October Fab-lab

The STEM October Fab-lab (Fabrication laboratory) is a lab where students can learn hands-on design, engineering, and manufacturing skills. 
It typically includes a range of tools, equipment and technology such as 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, microcontrollers, and other electronics and materials to allow students to turn their ideas into applied projects. 
The goal is to provide students with real-world experiences and skills in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields.
